Project Description

a3_ novelvisualization
  This .pde randomly generates words from uniquewords.txt and fits as many of these words as possible onto the 700x600px canvas. The words are in line-row format. The font, Copperplate Gothic Bold, is a typeface that was designed in the early 20th century, specifically in 1901 by Frederic W. Goudy. Its design and characteristics share some similarities with fonts from the 1920s era. 'The Sun Also Rises' was written in 1926, hence the choice of font. The font colors include red, orange, and yellow, which represent the colors of our Sun. Size-24 font was used simply for its aesthetic appearance and dimensions on a 700x600px canvas. When the user clicks the window, a new set of words from uniquewords.txt is generated.
